This is the current list of things that need to be refactored, in order for 
the design.txt file to be correct, rather than a wish-list. The list 
actually starts with things that adhere fully to the design.txt so it is 
not advisable to change them.

Working things:
 1. LCH Colour Settings,
 2. Camera,
 3. Pitch,
 4. Global Info,
 5. Static Ball Info,
 6. Static Info,
 7. Static Info History,
 8. Dynamic Ball Info,
 9. Dynamic Info,
10. Eye,
11. Static Robot Info,
12. Dynamic Robot Info,
13. Visual Cortex Skeleton,
14. Dynamic Robot Info,
15. Visual Cortex,
16. Overlord,
17. FieldMarshal, and
18. Artist.

TODO:
 3. Bakery: copy the information from the design.txt to the javadoc of the 
     class; audit code and see what should be modified so it adheres to the
     design



If you fancy eliminating todos, you should execute the needed steps, and 
 append information on what was fixed to the Awaiting Approval list, with
 your name next to it. Then two persons should separately check your 
 implementation and sign that they are happy with the changes, next to the 
 list item in the AA list. Items with more than three names next to them, 
 get moved to the perfect list.

No code should be considered perfect if it has no javadoc comments.
